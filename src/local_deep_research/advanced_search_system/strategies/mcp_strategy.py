"""
MCP Strategy using ReAct pattern (Reasoning + Acting).

This strategy makes LDR behave more like Claude - thinking about requests,
calling tools (MCP and web search), analyzing results, and iterating
until the query is properly answered.

Unlike traditional strategies with fixed pipelines, the LLM decides
what to do at each step based on what it has learned.

REACT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a research assistant. Today's date: {current_date}

You MUST search before answering. Do NOT answer from memory. Do NOT ask clarifying questions.

## Tool Selection — pick the right tool for the domain:

{engine_routing_table}

**Strategy**: Start with a quick direct search (web_search or search_[engine]) to learn about the topic. Only use focused_research after initial exploration — it runs many search rounds and is slow.

## Tools:

- **web_search** — General web search. You control the query — use exact phrases, date ranges, site filters.
- **search_[engine]** — Single query against a specialized database. Fast and targeted. Only the engines listed above are registered; calling any other ``search_<engine>`` name will fail and may route through a network the user explicitly chose not to use.
- **focused_research** — Deep iterative research with multiple automatic search rounds. Optional parameters:
  - **iterations** (1-25): Search rounds. Default 8. Use 15-20+ for exhaustive research. More iterations = deeper.
  - **search_engine**: Override which engine to use (e.g. one of the engines listed above). Powerful for domain-specific deep dives.
- **download_content** — Fetch full text from a URL (papers, articles, web pages).

## Response format:

THOUGHT: [your reasoning]
ACTION: [tool_name]
ARGUMENTS: {{"query": "search terms"}}

After searching, give your final answer:
THOUGHT: [summary of what you found]
ANSWER: [comprehensive answer citing sources as [1], [2], etc.]

## Rules:
1. ALWAYS search before answering
2. Use THOUGHT: then ACTION: then ARGUMENTS: format
3. Cite sources as [1], [2], etc. in your ANSWER
4. Start with quick searches, escalate to focused_research only if needed
5. Only invoke the engines listed in the Tool Selection table — never invent a ``search_<engine>`` name from training data. If you need a specialised engine that isn't listed, use web_search instead.

    The previous hardcoded table listed ``search_pubmed`` /

    root cause of the darkweb-research-going-to-wikipedia incident:
    the LLM was told "Background knowledge: search_wikipedia" and
    happily called it even though the user picked a Tor-isolated
    engine.

    Now we generate the table from the engines that survived both
    ``get_available_engines()`` and the network-isolation filter. If
    no specialised engines are available (e.g. darkweb-isolated
