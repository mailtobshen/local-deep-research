"""Agent-facing ``fetch_content`` tool builders.

Public API:
    FETCH_MODES         — tuple of valid mode strings.
    build_fetch_tool()  — returns a LangChain ``@tool`` (or ``None`` when
                          mode == "disabled" so the caller can skip
                          registration).

Modes:
    disabled              — fetch tool is not registered with the agent.
    full                  — return the full extracted page text (legacy
                            behavior; can flood small-model context with
                            boilerplate / metadata enrichment).
    summary_focus         — LLM extracts only spans relevant to a focus
                            question the agent supplies per call.
    summary_focus_query   — same as above, but the prompt also includes
                            the original research query (passed in
                            programmatically by the strategy) so the
                            extractor can disambiguate vague focuses.

Each tool registers fetched URLs in the strategy's
``SearchResultsCollector`` for citation tracking, returning the result as
``[N] Title: ...\\nURL: ...\\n\\n<body>`` exactly like the original
in-strategy implementation, so downstream prompt formatting is unchanged.
